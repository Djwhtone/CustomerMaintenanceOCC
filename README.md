# CustomerMaintenanceOCC
Customer Maintenance GUI created for UI. This was a project done as a student during my time at Owens Community College. This project dives into EFCore and how to utilize LINQ to retrieve and delete data. We established classes for OOP to allow creation of multiple instances. This not only reduces redundancy by allowing the classes to be reused when creating new objects but also allows us to do many things with ease such as scalability, inheritnace, and maintenence.
