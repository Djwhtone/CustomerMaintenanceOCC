# CustomerMaintenanceOCC
Customer Maintenance GUI created for UI. This was a project done as a student during my time at Owens Community College. This project dives into EFCore and how to utilize LINQ to retrieve or delete data. We established classes for OOP and to allow multiple instances. This not only reduces redundancy by allowing the classes to be reused when creating new objects but also allows us to do many things such as scalability, inheritnace, and maintaining.
